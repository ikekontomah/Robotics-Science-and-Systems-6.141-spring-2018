You are not wrong, who deem

While I weep--while I weep!
While I weep--while I weep!
O God! can I not save
In a vision, or in none,
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,

In a night, or in a day,
Them with a tighter clasp?
One from the pitiless wave?
Is but a dream within a dream.
All that we see or seem
O God! can I not save
Is it therefore the less gone?
And I hold within my hand
And I hold within my hand
Is but a dream within a dream.
Grains of the golden sand--

O God! can I not save
